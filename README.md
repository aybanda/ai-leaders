## Getting Started

The fastest way to work on this project is using AI-powered development tools.

### Option 1: AI-Powered Development (Recommended)

This project is optimized for AI-assisted coding. We recommend using tools like **Google Antigravity** or **Claude Code**.

1.  **Give Instructions**: Instead of memorizing terminal commands, simply tell your AI agent what you want to do:
    - *"Set up this project and start the development server."*
    - *"I want to add a new feature to the landing page."*
    - *"Fix the alignment on the navigation bar."*
2.  **Let the AI Handle the Rest**: Your AI agent will automatically install dependencies, run the development server, and manage file changes for you. 

### Option 2: Manual Setup (Traditional)

If you prefer using the command line:

1.  **Setup**:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd ai-leaders
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Run**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.
